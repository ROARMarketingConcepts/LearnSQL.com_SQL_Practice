-- For each course edition, display the students who have not passed the course in this edition. 
-- These are either students who have failed the course (passed is FALSE) or who havenâ€™t passed 
-- the course yet (passed is NULL). If there are no non-passing students for the course edition, 
-- include the edition in the result anyway and show NULL in the student column.

-- Display the course title, the course edition ID, the student first and last name, and the passed column.
