-- For each author, show:

-- Their id.
-- Their last name.
-- Their first name.
-- The name of the category in which they've published articles.
-- The day.
-- The total views in the given category on that day (name the column article_views_by_day_and_category).
-- The total views on that day for that author across all the categories (name the column article_views_by_day).
-- The total accumulated views by the author from the day they published their first article up to the current 
-- day for the given category (name the column accumulated_article_views_by_category).
-- Order the results so that the authors are in alphabetical order by last name, then by first name. 
-- If there are multiple rows for the same author, order the rows by the category in ascending order 
-- nd by the day so that the most recent day is first.
